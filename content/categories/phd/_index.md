Beside [working at The University of Manchester](/about/) I am a [PhD Candidate](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/s/o/s.soilandreyes/s.soiland-reyes.html) in the [INDElab](https://indelab.org/) at the [Informatics Institute](http://ivi.uva.nl/) of the [University of Amsterdam](http://uva.nl/).

My supervisor is [Paul Groth](http://pgroth.com/) and my thesis title is _FAIR Research Objects and Computational Workflows â€“ A Linked Data Approach_.

I started in July 2019 and submitted in December 2023.

As I did a _thesis by publication_, these pages gather the articles submitted/accepted/published so far that became part of my PhD thesis. Note that some of these articles have been slightly reformatted to fit publication on the Web.
