I am a [PhD Candidate](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/s/o/s.soilandreyes/s.soiland-reyes.html) in the [INDElab](https://indelab.org/) at the [Informatics Institute](http://ivi.uva.nl/) of the [University of Amsterdam](http://uva.nl/).

My supervisor is [Paul Groth](http://pgroth.com/) and my topic is _Using Research Objects to improve reproducibility_. I started in July 2019.

As I am doing a _thesis by publication_, these pages gather the articles submitted/accepted/published so far that will become part of my PhD thesis. Note that some of these articles have been slightly reformatted to fit publication on the Web.
