In an alternate reality I am sure I would be a librarian.
 
With ongoing linkrot and degradation of old Internet content, in particular [reference rot](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0115253)
from academic literature, it can be hard to find digital content even from as recently as 10 years ago.

It follows that academics now should be their own library curator, to preserve
their own outputs and reference materials.

In this section I catalogue some of the content and software I have rescued, archived or rediscovered. 

Where textual content is made available from this website they are redistributed under an Open Access license such as [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/), in other cases I refer to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/) and [institutional repositories](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/).
