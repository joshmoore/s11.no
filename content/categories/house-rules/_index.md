Through my daily work as a pretend academic and open source developer I seem to
have developed a set of _house rules_ I enforce on myself. House Rules are
normally guides used within large organizations to encourage common approaches,
e.g. style guides for writing and design, or procedures for publishing.

Here I will try to gather these **s11 House Rules** as I find time to write
them down, hopefully some of them can be useful to others.
