To investigate [RQ1](../../../2022/phd/introduction/#rq1) this chapter evaluates both Linked Data and FAIR Digital Object (FDO) as ways to realize the FAIR principles. [Section 3.1]((../evaluating-fdo/)) compares the two approaches as global distributed object systems, and discusses what lessons can be learnt across the communities, taking into consideration the history covered by [section 2](../background/).

[Section 3.2](../../../2022/phd/updating-ld-for-fdo) proposes how the FDO principles can be achieved using Linked Data standards, which is explored further in the following chapters.

* Section 3.1: [Evaluating FAIR Digital Object and Linked Data as distributed object systems](../evaluating-fdo/)
* Section 3.2: [Updating Linked Data practices for FAIR Digital Object principles](../../../2022/phd/updating-ld-for-fdo/)
