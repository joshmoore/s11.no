This chapter introduces RO-Crate, a pragmatic method of packaging data alongside structured metadata that is inline with the FAIR principles. This has been implemented to investigate [RQ2](../../../2022/phd/introduction/#rq2).

[Section 4.1](../../../2022/phd/ro-crate/) describes the RO-Crate purpose, community effort and tooling and demonstrates how RO-Crate has been applied.

[Section 4.2](../../../2022/phd/fdo-with-ro-crate/) shows how RO-Crate can be used to achieve the FDO principles covered in [chapter 3](../fdo-and-linked-data/).

[Section 4.3](../../../2022/phd/ro-crate/formalizing/) contributes a formal definition of RO-Crate using first order logic.

Supplementary material that may assist readers of this chapter includes the motivation of [RO-Crate, a lightweight approach to Research Object data packaging](../../../2019/phd/ro-crate/) \[[Ó Carragáin 2019b]\].
RO-Crate builds on the long history of _Research Objects_, which is covered by earlier works
\[[Bechhofer 2013], [Belhajjame 2015], [Goble 2018]\] and the [Wf4Ever project](../../../2020/archive/wf4ever/).
