In the beginning of December 2012, the [W3C](http://www.w3.org "World Wide Web Consortium") [Provenance Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2011/prov "Provenance Working Group") issued a call for implementations. As of February the 25th 2013, 64 [PROV implementations](http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-implementations "PROV implementation report") were reported to the W3C Provenance Working Group.

These implementations took different forms ranging from stand alone applications (30), to reusable frameworks and libraries (10), to services hosted by third parties (9), to vocabularies (21), and constraints validation modules (3). 

The objective of this blog post is to examine how [PROV](http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm "PROV-DM") is being used. In particular, I will identify the prov concepts that are commonly used, and attempt to give an explanation of the figures obtained. In my analysis, I will focus on the first three components of PROV, viz., component 1 (_Entities_ and _Activities_), component 2 (_Derivations_) and component 3 (_Agents_, _Responsibility_, and _Influence_. 

The chart in Figure 1 summarizes the usage of concepts PROV in implementations of type Application, Framework/API and Service. In total, 40 implementations fall in those categories. The chart distinguishes between the _consumption_ and the _generation_ of a given concept by implementation. For each concept, the chart shows the number of implementation that consume instances of that concept, produce them, or both consume and produce them.

The analysis of this chart shows that the concepts in the three components Entities/Activities, Agents, Responsibilities, Influence, and Derivations are covered by the implementations. However, the frequency by which those concepts are covered varies. In particular, we observe that a large proportion of implementations supports (most of the) core concepts of PROV. 

PROV core concepts are illustrated in Figure 2. Specifically, the following core concepts: _Entity_, _Activity_, _Agent_, _Usage_ and _Generation_, are supported by almost all implementations. _Association_ and _Derivation_ are supported by more than ¾ of the implementations.

On the other hand, we observe that the core concepts of _Attribution_, _Communication_ and _Delegation_ are supported by less than half of the implementations. Specifically, 19 out of 40 implementations support _Attribution_, 14 support _Delegation_, and 12 support _Communication_. 

In the case of _Attribution_ and _Communication_, one can argue that they are actually (indirectly) supported by most of implementations. This is because _Attribution_ can be inferred using a chain of _Generation_ and _Association_, which are supported by most of implementations. Similarly, _Communication_ can be inferred using a chain of _Generation_ and _Usage_, which are supported by most of implementations. 

We also observe that the number of implementations that support _Plan_, which is not part of the core concepts illustrated in Figure 2, is large. Half of the implementations support this concept. This can be explained by the fact that most implementers felt the need to link the provenance traces produced by their system to the recipe that was followed. 


{{< figure src="prov_implementation_2.png" link="prov_implementation_2.png" id="fig:figure3" 
  width="100%" title="Coverage of PROV by Vocabularies that use PROV"

{{< figure src="prov_implementation_3.png" link="prov_implementation_3.png" id="fig:figure4" 
  width="100%" title="Coverage of PROV by Vocabularies that extend PROV"
  caption="" >}}

Figure 3 and 4 illustrate PROV concepts that are used and extended, respectively, by implementations of type vocabulary. In total, the working group received 8 vocabularies that _use_ PROV concepts, and 13 vocabularies that _extend_ them. 

The two charts confirms the observation made in the case of implementations of type applications, frameworks and Services. Most of PROV concepts seem to be used and extended by vocabularies. The frequency by which they are supported is different from one concept to another. In particular, (most of the) core concepts of PROV are supported by the majority of vocabularies. 

It is worth underlining that PROV is still in the process of being adopted. The existing implementations that we analyzed in this blog post show how PROV constructs create a firm foundation for provenance interoperability.
