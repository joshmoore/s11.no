Thank you for writing up detailed guidance on the provenance tools. Are you still seeing the email problem when signing up for an account on our server? I'm trying to determine if this issue a temporary glitch or something more persistent that requires attention. BTW, if you want to PROV-N syntax highlighting in Textmate or Sublime Text, there is a grammar file available. See this post for more information: https://trungdong.github.io/prov-n-textmate.html. It was done a while ago but I hope it still works (I've been using the same grammar file with Sublime Text since then).
