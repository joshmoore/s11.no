[![pav-paper-frontpage](http://practicalprovenance.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/pav-paper-frontpage.png?w=595)](http://www.jbiomedsem.com/content/pdf/2041-1480-4-37.pdf) Our recent [paper about the PAV ontology](http://www.jbiomedsem.com/content/4/1/37 "PAV ontology: provenance, authoring and versioning") has been classified as [highly accessed](http://www.jbiomedsem.com/content/4/1/37/about) by _Journal of Biomedical Semantics_, with more than 1097 views since it was published two months ago, with an [Altmetric score](http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1925490 "Altmetric score for PAV Ontology paper") of 12. The [PAV ontology](http://purl.org/pav/home "PAV homepage") provides a lightweight approach to record typical Provenance, Authorship and Versioning information, and builds upon existing standards like [PROV-O](http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/) and [DC Terms](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/ "DCMI Terms"). Our previous Practical Provenance post gives a brief [overview of PAV](http://practicalprovenance.wordpress.com/2013/03/28/pav/ "Recording authorship, curation and digital creation with the PAV ontology"), but you might also want to explore these links for more details:
