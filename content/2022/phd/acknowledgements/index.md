#### RO-Crate Community {#communitylist}


I am forever grateful for all the wonderful discussions, technical contributrions and long-lasting friendships formed in the RO-Crate community since its early inception [@OCarragain; @2019] at Workshop on Research Objects [(RO2018)](https://www.researchobject.org/ro2018/). Without you there would not have been any RO-Crate!

I would particularly like to thank Peter Sefton, without which co-chairing, enthusiasm and pragmatism I would easily had got lost the weeds. I am forever in debt to Eoghan Ó Carragáin who managed to get me and Peter to agree even on the trickiest issues, and led the community through its formative years.

I want to thank Simone Leo, which persistent work and leadership on [Workflow Run Crate](https://w3id.org/ro/wfrun/) and the RO-Crate Python library [@ro-crate-py] has shown that RO-Crate works in practice even for detailed provenance.

RO-Crate is standing on the shoulders of giants, and I would like to thank the whole Research Object community [@goble-ro2018] for persisting on the early RO ideas [@ch5-93; @Bechhofer; @2013]. I have particular fond memories of whiteboard sessions with Sean Bechhofer, Khalid Belhajjame, Paolo Missier, David De Roure and Kevin Page in the productive [Wf4Ever project](https://s11.no/2020/archive/wf4ever/) that laid the foundation for what is now RO-Crate.

As of 2023-06-15, the *RO-Crate* [Community members](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/community.html) are:
