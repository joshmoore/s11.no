# Thesis Overview

[Chapter 2](../../../2023/phd/background/) gives the background of concepts _FAIR Digital Object_ (FDO) and _Linked Data_, including a brief history of the _Semantic Web_ and a critical analysis of these technologies and their use. 

[Chapter 3](../../../2023/phd/fdo-and-linked-data/) contributes a framework-based evaluation of Linked Data and FDO as possible architectures for implementing a distributed object system for the purpose of FAIR data publishing, and discusses how the two approaches can benefit from each others strengths. 

[Chapter 4](../../../2023/phd/ro-crate/) introduces the contribution of _RO-Crate_, a pragmatic data packaging mechanism using Linked Data standards to implement FDO and be extensible for domain-specific metadata.  

[Chapter 5](../../../2023/phd/workflows/) explores the relationship between Computational Workflows and FAIR practices using RO-Crate and FDO, with use cases from molecular dynamics and specimen digitization. 

[Chapter 6](../conclusions/) summarizes and concludes the contributions from this thesis, and reflects on later developments and future work.

# Origins

[Chapter 2](../../../2023/phd/background/) and section [3.1](../../../2023/phd/evaluating-fdo/) is based on the preprint _Evaluating FAIR Digital Object and Linked Data as distributed object systems_ <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2306.07436>  (see appendices [A.4.1](../acknowledgements/#fdo) and [B.1.1](../contributions/#fdo)). I am the main author of this manuscript.

[Section 3.2](../updating-ld-for-fdo/) is based on _Updating Linked Data practices for FAIR Digital Object principles_ <https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.8.e94501> (see appendices [A.4.2](../acknowledgements/#updating-ld) and [B.1.2](../contributions/#updating-ld). I am the main author of this manuscript.

Sections [4.1](../ro-crate/) and [4.3](../ro-crate/formalizing/) are based on the publication _Packaging research artefacts with RO-Crate_ <https://doi.org/10.3233/DS-210053> (see appendices 
[A.4.3](../acknowledgements/#packagingrocrate-ld) and [B.1.3](../contributions/#packagingrocrate), [B.1.5](../contributions/#packagingrocrate)). I am the main author of this manuscript.

[Section 4.2](../fdo-with-ro-crate/) is based on the publication _Creating lightweight FAIR digital objects with RO-Crate_ <https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.8.e93937> (see appendices 
[A.4.4](../acknowledgements/#lightweight) and [B.1.4](../contributions/#lightweight). I am the main author of this manuscript.

[Section 5.1](../canonical-workflow-building-blocks/) is based on the publication _Making Canonical Workflow Building Blocks interoperable across workflow languages_ 
<https://doi.org/10.1162/dint_a_00135> (see appendices 
[A.4.5](../acknowledgements/#canonical) and [B.1.6](../contributions/#canonical).  I am the main author of this manuscript.

[Section 5.2](../specimen-data-refinery/) is based on the publication _The Specimen Data Refinery: A canonical workflow framework and FAIR Digital Object approach to speeding up digital mobilisation of natural history collections_
<https://doi.org/10.1162/dint_a_00134> 
(see appendices [A.4.7](../acknowledgements/#refinery) and [B.1.7](../contributions/#refinery). I mainly contributed to sections 
[5.2.2.2](../specimen-data-refinery/#workflow-management-systems-and-canonical-workflows-for-research), [5.2.2.3](../specimen-data-refinery/#fair-packaging-of-researchworkflow-objects-with-ro-crate), [5.2.4.1](../specimen-data-refinery/#fdo-types), [5.2.7](../specimen-data-refinery/#discussion) in this manuscript.

[Section 5.3](../incrementally-building-fdos/) is based on the publication \emph{Incrementally building FAIR Digital Objects with Specimen Data Refinery workflows} <https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.8.e94349> 
(see appendices [A.4.6](../acknowledgements/#incrementally-fdo) and [B.1.8](../contributions/#incrementally-fdo). I am the main author of this manuscript.
