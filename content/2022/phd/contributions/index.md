The doctoral manuscript that is submitted to the supervisor for final approval must be identical in form
and content to the doctoral thesis submitted to the Doctorate Committee for assessment and public
defence during the doctoral thesis defence ceremony. It should include the following elements:
a. a title page as supplied by the Office of the Beadle;
b. a table of contents;
c. an overview of the literature consulted;
d. if the doctoral thesis consists of articles or contains articles by multiple authors: a page with a
complete reference list for each article with a list of authors for each article and an explanation of the
relative contribution of the co-authors;
e. an explanation of how the research was funded, if applicable, as laid down in Article 29, paragraph 6;
f. a separate summary bearing the title of the thesis in the language in which it is written;
g. a separate summary bearing the title of the thesis, both in Dutch;
h. a separate summary bearing the title of the thesis, both in English.
An acknowledgements section is optional.

...

If the thesis manuscript includes articles that have been written by several authors, it is the duty of the
supervisor to evaluate whether the doctoral candidate has made an independent contribution to the
articles that is sufficient to warrant the conferral of the doctorate. If necessary, the supervisor will inform
the Doctorate Committee of the manner in which the articles were written and what the contribution of
the doctoral candidate was. 
As defined in Article 15, paragraph 5, the candidate is required to include a
list of references in the thesis manuscript

all the other contributors and their affiliations.
