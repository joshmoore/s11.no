<h1 id="sec:intro">Introduction</h1>
<p><span id="sec:introduction" label="sec:introduction">[sec:introduction]</span> <em>Computational Workflows</em> are widely used in data analysis, enabling innovation and decision-making for the modern society. But their growing popularity is also a cause for concern: unless we standardize computational reuse and portability, the use of workflows may end up hampering collaboration. How can we enjoy the common benefits of computational workflows and also eliminate such risks?</p>
<p><em>Workflow thinking</em>  <span class="citation" data-cites="gryk_workflows_2017">(Gryk and Ludäscher 2017)</span>. <span>It introduces an abstraction, the workflow, which</span> helps decouple expertise in a specific domain, for example of <span>specific</span> science or engineering <span>fields</span>, from expertise in computing. Derived from workflow thinking, a <em>computational workflow</em> describes a process for computing where different parts of the process (the tasks) are inter-dependent, e.g., a task can start processing after its predecessors have (partially) completed and where data flows between tasks.</p>
<p>Currently, many competing systems , each with their own syntax or method for describing workflows and infrastructure requirements. This limits computational reuse and portability. In particular, although the data-flows are becoming increasingly more complex, most workflow abstractions do not enable explicit specifications of data-flows, increasing significantly the costs to reuse and port the workflow by third-parties.</p>
<p>We thus identify an important problem for the broad adoption of workflow thinking in practice: although communities <span>require</span> polylingual <span>workflows (workflows that execute tools written in multiple different computer languages)</span> and multi-party workflows, <strong>adopting and managing different workflow systems is costly and difficult</strong>. In this work, we propose to tame this complexity through a common abstraction that covers the majority of features used in practice, and is (or can be) implemented in many workflow systems.</p>

</div>
<p>In the computational workflow depicted in Figure <a href="#fig:sample_workflow" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:sample_workflow">[fig:sample_workflow]</a>, practitioners solved the problem by adopting <span>the CWL standards.</span> We posit in this work that the <span>CWL standards</span> can help solve the main problems of sharing workflows between institutions and users. We also set out to introduce the CWL standards, with a tri-fold focus: (1) <span>the CWL standards</span> focuses on maintaining a separation of concerns between the description and execution of tools and workflows<span>, proposing a language that includes only operations commonly used across multiple communities of practice</span>; (2) <span>the CWL standards</span> support workflow automation, scalability, abstraction, provenance, portability, and reusability; and (3) the CWL project takes a principled, community-first open-source and open-standard approach which enables this result.</p>
<p><span>The CWL standards are</span> the product of an open and free standards-making community. <span>While the CWL project</span> began in the bioinformatics domain<span>the many <span>contributors to the CWL project</span> shaped the standards so that it could be useful anywhere that experiences the problem of “many tools written in many programming languages by many parties”</span>. Since the ratification of the first version in 2016, the CWL standards have been used in other fields including hydrology, radio astronomy<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, geo-spatial analysis <span class="citation" data-cites="simonis_ogc_2020 goncalves_ogc_2020 landry_ogc_2020">(Simonis 2020; Gonçalves 2020; Landry 2020)</span>, high energy physics <span class="citation" data-cites="bell_web-based_2017">(Bell et al. 2017)</span>, in addition to fast-growing bioinformatics fields like genomics <span class="citation" data-cites="mitchell_mgnify_2020">(Mitchell et al. 2020)</span> and cancer research <span><span class="citation" data-cites="lau_cancer_2017">(Lau et al. 2017)</span></span>. . The flexibility of <span>the CWL standards</span> enabled, for example, rapid collaboration on and prototyping of a COVID-19 public database and analysis resource <span class="citation" data-cites="guarracino_covid-19_2020">(Guarracino et al. 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>The separation of concerns proposed by <span>the CWL standards</span> enable diverse projects, and <span>can</span> also benefit engineering and large industrial projects. Likewise, users of <span>Docker (or other software container technologies)</span> that distribute analysis tools can use <span>just the CWL Command Line Tool standard</span> for providing a structured workflow-independent description of how to run their <span>tool(s) in the container, what data is required to be provided to the container, and what results to expect and where to find them in the container</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Key Insights [in CACM box]</strong></p>

<h1 id="sec:bg">Background on Workflows and Standards for Workflows</h1>
<p><span id="sec:why" label="sec:why">[sec:why]</span></p>
<p>Workflows, and standards-based descriptions thereof, hold the potential to solve key problems in many domains of science and engineering. This section explains why.</p>
<h2 id="sec:bg:workflows">Why Workflows?</h2>
<p>In many domains, workflows include diverse analysis components, written in multiple (different) computer languages, by both end-users and third-parties. Such <em>polylingual</em> and multi-party workflows are already common or dominant in data-intensive fields like bioinformatics, image analysis, and radio astronomy; we envision they could bring important benefits to many other domains.</p>
<p>To thread data through analysis tools, domain experts such as bioinformaticians use specialized command-line interfaces <span class="citation" data-cites="seemann_ten_2013 georgeson_bionitio_2019">(Seemann 2013; Georgeson et al. 2019)</span> and other domains use their own customized frameworks <span class="citation" data-cites="babuji_parsl_2019 berthold_knime_2009">(Babuji et al. 2019; Berthold et al. 2009)</span>. Workflow engines also help with efficient management of the resources used to run scientific workloads <span class="citation" data-cites="deelman_pegasus_2015 couvares_workflow_2007">(Deelman et al. 2015; Couvares et al. 2007)</span>.</p>
<p>The workflow approach helps compose an entire application of these command-line analysis tools: developers build graphical or textual descriptions of how to run these command-line tools, and scientists and engineers connect their inputs and outputs so that the data flows through. An example of a complex workflow problem is metagenomic analysis, for which Figure <a href="#fig:sample_workflow" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:sample_workflow">[fig:sample_workflow]</a> illustrates a subset (a <em>sub-workflow</em>).</p>
<p>In practice, many research and engineering groups use workflows of the kind described in Figure <a href="#fig:sample_workflow" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:sample_workflow">[fig:sample_workflow]</a>. However, as highlighted in a recently published “Technology Toolbox” article <span class="citation" data-cites="perkel_workflow_2019">(Perkel 2019)</span> published in the journal Nature, these groups typically lack the ability to share and collaborate across institutions and infrastructures without costly manual translation of their workflows.</p>
<p>Using workflow techniques, especially with digital analysis processes, has become quite popular and does not look to be slowing down: one recently celebrated its 10,000th citation<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>; and over 309 computational <span>data analysis</span> workflow systems are known<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>A process, digital or otherwise, may grow to such complexity that the authors and users of that process have difficulties in understanding its structure, scaling the process, managing the running of the process, and keeping track of what happened in previous enactments of the process. Process dependencies may be undocumented, obfuscated, or otherwise effectively invisible; even an extensively documented process may be difficult to understand by outsiders or newcomers if a common framework or vocabulary is lacking. The need to run the process more frequently or with larger inputs is unlikely to be achieved by the initial entity (i.e., either script or person) running the process. What seemed once a reasonable manual step (<em>run this command here and then paste the result there; then call this person for permission</em>) will, under the pressure of porting and reusing, become a bottleneck. Informal logs (if any) will quickly become unsuitable for answering an organization’s need to understand <em>what</em> happened, <em>when</em>, by <em>whom</em>, and to <em>which</em> data.</p>
<p>Workflow techniques aim to solve these problems by providing the Abstraction, Scaling, Automation, and Provenance (<em>A.S.A.P.</em>) features <span class="citation" data-cites="cuevas-vicenttin_scientific_2012">(Cuevas-Vicenttín et al. 2012)</span>. Workflow constructs enable a clear abstraction about the <em>components</em>, the <em>relationships</em> between components, and the <em>inputs</em> and <em>outputs</em> of the components turning them into well-labeled tools with documented expectations. This abstraction enables <em>scaling</em> (execution can be parallelized and distributed), <em>automation</em> (the abstraction can be used by a workflow engine to track, plan, and manage execution of tasks), and <em>provenance</em> tracking (descriptions of tasks, executors, inputs, outputs; with timestamps, identifiers , and other logs, can be stored in relation to each other to later answer structured queries).</p>
<h2 id="sec:bg:standard">Why Workflow Standards?</h2>
<p>Although workflows are very popular, <span>prior to the CWL standards every workflow system was incompatible with every other</span>. This means that those users not using the CWL standards are required to express their computational workflows in a different way every time they have to use another workflow system leading to local success, but global <em>un</em>portability.</p>
<p>The success of workflows is now their biggest drawback: users are locked into a particular vendor, project, and often a particular hardware setup. This hampers sharing and re-use. Even non-academics suffer from this situation, as the lack of standards (or the lack of their adoption) hinders effective collaboration on computational methods within and between companies. Likewise, this <em>unportability</em> affects public-private partnerships and the potential for technology transfer from public researchers.</p>
<p><span>A second significant problem is that incomplete method descriptions are common when computational analysis is reported in academic research <span class="citation" data-cites="ivie_reproducibility_2018">(Ivie and Thain 2018)</span>. Reproduction, re-use, and replication <span class="citation" data-cites="feitelson_repeatability_2015">(Feitelson 2015)</span> of these digital methods requires a complete description of what computer applications were used, how exactly they were used, and how they were connected to each other. For precision and interoperability, this description should also be in an appropriate standardized machine-readable format.</span></p>
<p>A standard for sharing and reusing workflows can provide a solution to describing portable, re-usable workflows while also being workflow-engine and vendor-neutral.</p>
<p><span>Sharing <em>workflow descriptions based on standards</em> also addresses the second problem: the availability of the workflow description provides needed information when sharing; and the quality of the description provided by a structured, standards-based approach is much higher than the current approach of <span>casual, unstructured, and almost always incomplete</span> descriptions in scientific reports. Moreover, the operational parts of the description can be provided automated by the workflow management system, rather than by domain experts.</span></p>
<h2 id="sec:sidebar:a">Sidebar A: Monolingual and Polylingual workflow systems</h2>
<p>Workflows techniques can be implemented in many ways, i.e., with varying degrees of formalism, which tends to correlate with execution flexibility and features. Typically, whereas the most <em>informal techniques</em> require that all processing components are written in the same programming language or are at least callable from the same programming language, the <em>formal workflow techniques</em> tend to allow components to be developed in multiple programming languages.</p>
<p>Among the informal techniques, the <em>do-it-yourself approach</em> uses from a particular programming language its built-in capabilities. For example, Python provides a <em>threading</em> library, and the Java-based Apache Hadoop <span class="citation" data-cites="taylor_overview_2010">(Taylor 2010)</span> provides MapReduce capabilities. To gain more flexibility when working with a particular programming language, <em>general third-party libraries</em>, such as <em>ipyparallel</em><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, can enable remote or distributed execution without having to re-write one’s code.</p>
<p>A more explicit workflow structure can be achieved by using a <em>workflow library</em> focusing on a specific programming language. For example, in Parsl <span class="citation" data-cites="babuji_parsl_2019">(Babuji et al. 2019)</span>, the workflow constructs (“this is a unit of processing,” “here are the dependencies between the units”) are made explicit and added by the developer to a Python script, to upgrade it to a scalable workflow. (<span>While we list Parsl here</span> as an example of a <strong>monolingual</strong> workflow system, it also contains explicit support for executing external command-line tools.)</p>
<p>Two approaches can accommodate <strong>polylingual</strong> workflows where the components are written in more than one programming language, or where the components come from third-parties and the user does not want to or cannot modify them: use of per-language <em>add-in libraries</em> or the use of the <em>Portable Operating System Interface command-line interface (POSIX CLI)</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="the_austin_group_posix1-2008_2008">(Group 2008)</span>. The use of per-language add-in libraries entails either explicit function calls (e.g., using <em>ctypes</em> in Python to call a C library<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>) or the addition of annotations to the user’s functions, and requires mapping/restricting to a common cross-language data model.</p>
<p>Essentially all programming languages support the creation of <strong>POSIX CLIs</strong> <span>are familiar</span> to many Linux and macOS users; scripts or binaries which can be invoked on the shell with a set of arguments, reading and writing files, and executed in a separate process. Choosing the POSIX command-line interface as the point of coordination means the connection between components is done by an array of string <em>arguments</em> representing program options (including paths to data files) along with a string-based <em>environment variables</em> (key-value pairs). <span>Using the command-line as a coordination interface has the advantage of not needing additional implementation in every programming language, but has the disadvantages of process start-up time and a very simple data model.</span> (As a <em>polylingual</em> workflow standard, CWL uses the POSIX CLI data model.)</p>

<h1 id="sec:features">Features of the Common Workflow Language standards</h1>
<p><span id="sec:design" label="sec:design">[sec:design]</span></p>
<p><span>The CWL standard support</span> polylingual and multi-party workflows, for which <span>they enable</span> computational reuse and portability (see also the CACM Box for main features). To do so, each release of <span>the CWL standards</span> has two<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> main components: (1) a standard for describing <em>command line</em> tools; and (2) a standard for describing <em>workflows</em> that compose such tool descriptions. The goal of the <strong>CWL Command Line Tool Description Standard</strong><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> is to describe how a particular command line tool works: what are the <em>inputs</em> and <em>parameters</em> and their types; how to add the correct flags and switches to the <em>command line</em> invocation; and where to find the <em>output files</em>.</p>
<p><span>The CWL standards</span> define an <em>explicit language</em>, both in syntax, and in its data and execution model. <span>Its</span> textual syntax is derived from YAML<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>. <span>This</span> syntax does not restrict the amount of detail; for example, Figure <a href="#fig:syntax" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:syntax">[fig:syntax]</a>A depicts a simple example with sparse detail, and Figure <a href="#fig:syntax" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:syntax">[fig:syntax]</a>B depicts the same example but with the execution augmented with further details. Each <em>input</em> to a tool has a name and a type (e.g., File, see label 1 in the figure). Authors of tool descriptions are encouraged to include <em>documentation</em> and <em>labels</em> for all components (i.e., as in Figure <a href="#fig:syntax" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:syntax">[fig:syntax]</a>B), to enable the automatic generation of helpful visual depictions and even Graphical User Interfaces for any given CWL description. <em>Metadata</em> about the tool description authors themselves encourages attribution of their efforts. <span>As shown in Figure <a href="#fig:syntax" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:syntax">[fig:syntax]</a>B, item 3, these tool descriptions can contain <em>hints</em> or <span>mandatory <em>requirements</em></span> such as which software container to use or how much compute resources are required (memory, number of CPU cores, disk space, and/or the maximum time or deadline to complete the step or entire workflow.)</span></p>
<p><em>The CWL execution model is explicit</em>: Each tool’s runtime environment is explicit and any <span>required</span> elements must be specified by the CWL tool-description author.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Each tool invocation uses a separate working directory, populated according to the CWL tool description, e.g., with the input files explicitly specified by the workflow author.</p>
<div class="figure*">
<p><embed src="figure3.pdf" style="width:80.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p><strong>The explicit runtime model enables portability</strong>, by being explicit about data locations. As Figure <a href="#fig:portability" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:portability">[fig:portability]</a> indicates, this enables execution of CWL workflows on diverse environments as provided by various implementations of the CWL standards: the local environment of the author-scientist (e.g., a single desktop computer, laptop, or workstation), a remote batch production-environment (e.g., a cluster, an entire datacenter, or even a global multi-datacenter infrastructure), and an on-demand cloud environment.</p>
<p><span>The CWL standards explicitly support</span> the use of <em>software container</em> technologies, such as Docker and Singularity, to enable portability of the underlying analysis tools. Figure <a href="#fig:syntax" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:syntax">[fig:syntax]</a>B, item 2, illustrates the process of pulling a Docker container-image from the <a href="Quay.io">Quay.io</a> registry; then, the workflow engine automates the mounting of files and folders within the container. The container included in the figure has been developed by a trusted author and is commonly used in the bioinformatics field with an expectation its results are reproducible. Indeed, the use of containers can be seen as a confirmation that a tool’s execution is reproducible, when using only its explicitly declared runtime-environment. Similarly, when <em>distributed execution</em> is desired, no changes to the CWL tool-description are needed: because the file or directory inputs are already explicitly defined in the CWL description, the (distributed) can handle (without additional configuration) both job placement and data routing between compute nodes.</p>
<p>To support features that are <em>not</em> in the CWL standards, <span>the CWL standards define</span> <em>extension points</em> that permit (namespaced) vendor-specific features in explicitly defined ways. If these extensions do not fundamentally change how the tool should operate, then they are list and other CWL <span>compatible</span> engines can ignore them. However, if the extension is required to properly run the tool being described, e.g., due to the need for some specialized hardware, then the extension is listed under <em>requirements</em> and CWL compatible engines can recognize and explicitly declare their inability to execute that CWL description.</p>
<p>The <strong>CWL Workflow Description Standard</strong><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> builds upon the CWL Command Line Tool Standard: it has the same YAML- or JSON-style syntax, with explicit workflow level inputs, outputs, and documentation (see Figure <a href="#fig:syntax" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:syntax">[fig:syntax]</a><span>C</span>). The workflow descriptions consists of a list of <em>steps</em>, comprised of CWL CommandLineTools or CWL sub-workflows, each re-exposing their tool’s required <em>inputs</em>. Inputs are connected <span>by referencing the name of either</span> the common <em>workflow inputs</em> or <span>particular</span> outputs of other steps. The <em>workflow outputs</em> expose selected outputs from workflow steps, making explicit which intermediate step outputs will be returned from the workflow. All connections include identifiers, which CWL document authors are encouraged to name meaningfully, e.g., <code>reference_genome</code> instead of <code>input7</code>.</p>
<p>CWL workflows form explicit <em>data flows</em>, as required for the particular computational analysis. The connectivity between steps defines the partial execution order. Parallel execution of steps is permitted and encouraged whenever multiple steps have all of their inputs satisfied, e.g., in Figure <a href="#fig:sample_workflow" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:sample_workflow">[fig:sample_workflow]</a>, <code>find_16S_matches</code> and <code>find_S5_matches</code> are at the same data dependency level and can execute concurrently or sequentially in any order. <span>(perhaps overlapping in time, depending on the resources available) where most of the inputs are the same except for one or more inputs that vary. This is done without requiring the modification of the underlying tool description.</span> Starting with CWL version 1.2, workflows can also conditionally <em>skip execution</em> of a (tool or workflow) step, based upon a specified intermediate input or custom boolean evaluation. Combining these features allows for a flexible <em>branch</em> mechanism that allows workflow engines to calculate data dependencies before the workflow starts, and thus retains the predictability of the data flow paradigm.</p>
<p>In contrast to hard-coded approaches that rely on implicit file-paths particular for each workflow, CWL workflows are more <em>flexible</em>, <em>reusable</em>, and <em>portable</em> (which enables scalability). The use in the CWL standards of explicit runtime environments, combined with explicit inputs/outputs to form the data flow, enables step reordering and explicit handling of iterations. The same features enable <em>scalable</em> remote execution and, more generally, flexible use of runtime environments. Moreover<span>,</span> individual tool definitions from multiple workflows can be reused in any new workflow.</p>
<p>CWL workflow descriptions are also <em>future-proof</em>. Forward compatibility of CWL documents is guaranteed, as each CWL document declares which version of the standards it was written for and minor versions do not alter the required features of the major version. A stand-alone upgrader<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> can automatically upgrade CWL documents from one version to the next, and many CWL-aware platforms will internally update user-submitted documents at runtime.</p>
<h2 id="sec:execution">Execution of workflows in CWL format</h2>
<p>CWL is a set of standards, not a particular software product to install, purchase, or rent. The CWL standards need to be implemented to be useful; a list of some implementations of the CWL standards is in Table <a href="#tab:runners" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:runners">1</a>. Workflow/tool runners that claim compliance with the CWL standards are allowed significant flexibility in how and where they execute a user’s CWL documents as long as they fulfill the requirements written in those documents. For example, they are allowed (and encouraged) to distribute execution of a workflow across all available computers that can fulfill the resource requirements specified by the user. Aspects of execution not defined by the CWL standards include (web) APIs for workflow execution and real-time monitoring.</p>
<p>For example details about when a step should be considered ready for execution are available in §4 of CWL Workflow Description standard<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> but once all the inputs are available the exact timing is up to the workflow engine itself.</p>
<p>Step execution may result in a temporary or permanent failure, as defined in §4 of CWL Workflow Description standard<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>. It is up to the workflow engine to control any automatic attempts to recover from failures, e.g., to re-execute a Workflow step. Most workflow engines that implement the CWL standards offer the feature of attempting a number of re-executions, as set by the user, before reporting permanent failure.</p>
<p>The CWL community has developed the following optimizations without requiring that users re-write their workflows to benefit:</p>
<ol class="incremental">
<li><p>Automatic streaming of data inputs and outputs instead of waiting for all the data to be downloaded or uploaded (where those data inputs or outputs are marked with “streamable: true”)</p></li>
<li><p>Workflow step placement based upon data location <span class="citation" data-cites="jiang_tr-19-01_2019">(Jiang, Castillo, and Ahalt 2019)</span>, resource needs, and/or cost of data transfer <span class="citation" data-cites="jiang_pivot_2019">(Jiang, Ferriter, and Castillo 2019)</span></p></li>
<li><p>The re-use of the results from previously computed steps, even from a different workflow, as long as the inputs are identical. This can be controlled by the user via the “WorkReuse” directive<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Real world usage at scale: routinely CWL users and vendors report that they analyze 5000 whole genome sequences in a single workflow execution; one customer of a commercial vendor reported a successful run of a workflow that contained an 8,000-wide step; the entire workflow had 25,000 container executions. By design, the CWL standards do not impose any technical limitations to the size of files processed or to the number of tasks run in parallel. The major scalability bottlenecks are hardware-related — not having enough machines with enough memory, compute or disk space to process more and more data at a larger scale. As these boundaries move in the future with technological advances, the CWL standards should be able to keep up and not be a cause of limitations.</p>
<h2 id="sec:limitations">When is CWL not useful?</h2>
<p>The CWL standards were designed for a particular style of command-line tool based data analysis. Therefore, the following situations are out of scope and not appropriate (or possible) to describe using CWL syntax:</p>
<ol class="incremental">
<li><p>Safe interaction with stateful (web) services</p></li>
<li><p>Real-time communication between workflow steps</p></li>
<li><p>Interactions with command line tools beside 1) constructing the command line and making available file inputs (both user provided and synthesized from other inputs just prior to execution) and 2) consuming the output of the tool once its execution is finished, in the form of files created/changed, the POSIX standard output and error streams, and the POSIX exit code of the tool</p></li>
<li><p>Advanced control-flow techniques beyond conditional steps</p></li>
<li><p>Runtime workflow graph manipulations: dynamically adding or removing new steps during workflow execution, beyond any predefined conditional step execution tests that are in the original workflow description</p></li>
<li><p>Workflows that contain cycles: “repeat this step or sub-workflow a specific number of times” or “repeat this step or sub-workflow until a condition is met.”<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Workflows that need particular steps run at or during a specific day/time-frame</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="sec:open">Open-Source, Open Standards, Open Community</h1>
<p>Given the numerous and diverse set of potential users, implementers, and other stakeholders, we posit that a project like CWL requires <span>the</span> combined development of code, standards, and community. Indeed, these requirements were part of the foundational design principles for CWL (Section <a href="#sec:open:principles" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:open:principles">4.1</a>); in the long run, these have fostered free and open source software (Sidebar B, in Section <a href="#sec:sidebar:b" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:sidebar:b">4.2</a>), and a vibrant and active ecosystem (Section <a href="#sec:open:ecosystem" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:open:ecosystem">4.3</a>).</p>
<h2 id="sec:open:principles">The CWL Principles</h2>
<p><span>The CWL project</span> is based on a set of five principles:</p>
<p><strong>Principle 1</strong>: The core of the project is the community of people who care about its goals.</p>
<p><strong>Principle 2</strong>: To achieve the best possible results, there should be few, if any, barriers to participation. Specifically, to attract people with diverse experiences and perspectives, there must be no cost to participate.</p>
<p><strong>Principle 3</strong>: To enable the <span>best outcomes</span>, project outputs should be used as people see fit. Thus, the standards themselves must be licensed for reuse, with no acquisition price.</p>
<p><strong>Principle 4</strong>: The project must not favor any one company or group over another, but neither should it try to be all things to all people. The community decides.</p>
<p><strong>Principle 5</strong>: The concepts and ideas must be tested frequently: tested and functional code is the beginning of evaluating a proposal, not the end.</p>
<p>In time, the CWL project-members learned that this approach is a superset of the OpenStand Principles<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>, a joint “Modern Paradigm for Standards” promoted by the IAB, IEEE, IETF, Internet Society, and W3C. The CWL <span>project</span> additions to the OpenStand Principles are: (1) to keep participation free of cost, and (2) the explicit choice of the Apache 2.0 license for all its text, conformance tests, and reference implementations.</p>
<p><strong>Necessary and sufficient</strong>: All these principles have proven to be essential for the CWL project. For example, the free cost and open source license (Principles 2 and 3) has enabled many implementations of the CWL standards, several of which re-use different parts of the reference . Being community-first (Principle 1) has led to several projects from participants that are outside the CWL standards themselves; the most important contributions have made their way back into the project (Principle 4).</p>
<p>As part of Principle 5, contributors to the CWL project have developed a suite of conformance tests for each version of the CWL standards. These publicly available tests were critical to <span>the</span> CWL <span>project</span>’s success: they helped the reference implementation of <span>the CWL standards themselves</span>; they provided concrete examples to early adopters; and they enabled the developers and users of production implementations of the CWL standards to confirm their correctness.</p>

<h3 id="free-and-open-source-implementations-of-the-cwl-standards">Free and Open Source implementations of <span>the</span> CWL <span>standards</span></h3>
<p><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>By 2021, <span>the CWL standards have</span> gained much traction and <span>are</span> currently widely supported in practice. In addition to the implementations in Table <a href="#tab:runners" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:runners">1</a>, Galaxy <span class="citation" data-cites="afgan_galaxy_2018">(Afgan et al. 2018)</span><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> and Pegasus <span class="citation" data-cites="deelman_pegasus_2015">(Deelman et al. 2015)</span><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> have in-development support for <span>the CWL standards</span> as well.</p>
<p>Wide adoption benefits from our principles: <span>The CWL standards</span> include conformance tests, but the CWL community does not yet test or certify <span>implementations of the CWL standards</span>, or specific technology stacks. Instead, <span>the authors and service provides of workflow runners and workflow management systems</span> self-certify support for the CWL standards, based on a particular technology configuration they deploy and maintain.</p>

<p>There are tools to generate CWL <span>syntax</span> from Python (via argparse/click <span>or via functions</span>), ACD<span><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></span>, CTD<span><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></span>, and annotations in IPython Jupyter Notebooks. Libraries to generate and/or read CWL <span>documents</span> exist in many languages: Python, Java, R, Go, Scala, <span>Javascript, Typescript,</span> and C++.</p>
<h2 id="sec:open:ecosystem">The CWL Ecosystem</h2>
<p>Beyond the ratified initial and updated CWL standards released over the last six years, the CWL community has developed many <em>tools, software libraries, connected specifications</em>, and has shared CWL descriptions for popular tools. For example, there are software development kits for both Python<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> and Java<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> that are generated automatically from the CWL schema; this allows programmers to load, modify, and save CWL documents using an object oriented model that has direct correspondence to the CWL standards themselves. CWL SDKs for other languages are possible by extending the code generation routines<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a>. (See Sidebar B in Section <a href="#sec:sidebar:b:workwith" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:sidebar:b:workwith">[sec:sidebar:b:workwith]</a> for practical details.)</p>
<p><span>The CWL standards</span> support well the acute <em>need to reuse</em> (and, correspondingly, <em>to share</em>) information on workflow execution, and on authoring and provenance. The CWLProv<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> prototype was created to show how existing standards <span class="citation" data-cites="belhajjame_using_2015 kunze_bagit_2018 missier_w3c_2013">(Belhajjame et al. 2015; Kunze et al. 2018; Missier, Belhajjame, and Cheney 2013)</span> can be combined to represent the provenance of a specific execution of a CWL workflow <span class="citation" data-cites="khan_sharing_2019">(Khan et al. 2019)</span>. Although, to-date, CWLProv has only been implemented in the CWL reference runner, interest is high in additional implementation and further development.</p>
<h1 id="sec:conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The problem of standardizing computational reuse is only increasing in prominence and impact. Addressing this problem, various domains in science, engineering, and commerce have already started to migrate to workflows, but efforts focusing on the portability and even definition of workflows remain scattered. In this work we raise awareness to this problem and propose a community-driven solution.</p>
<p>The Common Workflow Language (CWL) is a family of standards for the description of command line tools and of workflows made from these tools. It includes many features developed in collaboration with the community: support for software containers, resource requirements, workflow-level conditional branching, etc. Built on a foundation of five guiding principles, the CWL project delivers open standards, open-source code, and an open community.</p>
<p>For the past six years, the community around CWL has developed organically.</p>
<p>To conclude: this is a call for others to embrace workflow thinking and join the CWL community <span>in creating and sharing portable and complete workflow descriptions.</span> !</p>
