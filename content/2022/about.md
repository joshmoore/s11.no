## Biography
Stian Soiland-Reyes is a Technical Architect and Research Associate at the [eScience Lab](https://esciencelab.org.uk/ "eScience Lab at The University of Manchester") in the Department of Computer Science. 

As a joint researcher and software developer he is working on _reproducibility_, _provenance_ and _metadata_ to improve [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/ "FAIR principles") sharing of open research data and [computational workflows](https://doi.org/10.1162/dint_a_00033), within [ELIXIR Europe](https://elixir-europe.org/), European Open Science Cloud ([EOSC](https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/strategy/goals-research-and-innovation-policy/open-science/european-open-science-cloud-eosc_en)) projects including [EOSC-Life](https://www.eosc-life.eu/) and the workflow repository [WorkflowHub.eu](https://workflowhub.eu/), as well as building [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) approaches for high-performance compute (HPC) environments within [BioExcel](https://bioexcel.eu/). Stian contributed to the [W3C PROV](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/) standard and its [implementation in workflow systems](https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giz095 "Sharing interoperable workflow provenance: A review of best practices and their practical application in CWLProv"). 

As one of the early founders to the [Research Object](https://www.researchobject.org/) approach for sharing research outputs using Linked Data, he is now the co-lead of [RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/), a community-based lightweight approach to packaging and publishing research data with structured metadata. 

Stian is on the leadership team of [Common Workflow Language](https://www.commonwl.org/), a standard for interoperable computational workflow, as well as on the technical steering committee for [BioCompute Object](https://www.biocomputeobject.org/), an approach for describing workflows for submission to regulatory authorities. He graduated in 2006 with an MSc in Computer Science from the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)](https://www.ntnu.no/). 

He has more than two decades of experience as an IT professional, including 15 years as a software developer working across academia and industry. He joined the [myGrid team](http://www.mygrid.org.uk/) in 2005 (now [eScience Lab](https://esciencelab.org.uk/ "eScience Lab")), where he became the _Technical Lead Developer_ of the successful, open-source scientific workflow management system [Taverna](http://taverna.incubator.apache.org/), which he helped transition to the [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/ "ASF") incubator. As part of the EU FP7-funded [Wf4Ever project](http://www.wf4ever-project.org/), Stian contributed to the [W3C PROV](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/ "W3C PROV-Overview") specifications for capturing provenance and co-developed the [Research Object](http://www.researchobject.org/) model and ontologies. 

Currently Stian is mainly working with **[BioExcel](http://bioexcel.eu/)**, a Centre of Excellence for Computational Biomolecular Research, where his focus is on [workflows](http://bioexcel.eu/community/interest-groups/workflows-ig/), scalability, reproducibility, metadata.


## Memberships of committees and professional bodies

Stian has participated in [W3C](http://www.w3.org/) activities, co-authoring W3C Recommendations for [Provenance](http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/), and collaborating on W3C Community efforts like [Open Annotation](http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/) (now [Web Annotation Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/)), [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org/) and [w3id](https://w3id.org/). He edited the [ORE JSON-LD](http://www.openarchives.org/ore/0.9/jsonld) specification. He is part of the [Common Workflow Language](http://www.commonwl.org/) leadership team and co-author of the [CWL specification](http://www.commonwl.org/v1.0/). He is a [Force11 member](https://www.force11.org/users/stian-soiland-reyes), where he promotes reproducibility best practices and open science. He is a member of the Technical Steering Committee for [BioCompute Objects](http://biocomputeobject.org/), and co-chair of [Research Object Crate](http://researchobject.org/ro-crate/).

Stian is an active [open source developer](https://github.com/stain), and have contributed to software like [ORCID](https://github.com/ORCID/ORCID-Source), [Apache Jena](http://jena.apache.org/), [OWL API](https://github.com/owlcs/owlapi), [JSON-LD Java](https://github.com/jsonld-java/jsonld-java), as well as maintaining several [Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/u/stain/).  He is a [Foundation Member](https://www.apache.org/foundation/members) of the **[Apache Software Foundation](http://apache.org/)**, where he is a on the [Project Management Committee](https://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html) of [Apache Commons](http://commons.apache.org/),  and [Apache Incubator](http://incubator.apache.org/). He is a committer on [Apache Taverna](http://taverna.incubator.apache.org/) (incubating) and PMC member of [Commons RDF](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-rdf/). He is a curator of [jai-imageio-core](https://github.com/jai-imageio/jai-imageio-core) and [beanshell](https://github.com/beanshell/beanshell).
