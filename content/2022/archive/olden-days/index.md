## Archived personal websites

These are slightly embarrassing archives from more innocent times, preserved so you can see why I didn't become a Web designer.

* [La familia Soiland-Reyes](https://soiland-reyes.com/archive-2008/) (2008--2010) -- Website for our wedding in 2008. Archived from Wordpress.
* [s11 solutions](https://web.archive.org/web/20060701000000*/s11.no) (2004--2006) -- This domain <http://s11.no/> used to host a parody of enterprise-targeting IT consultancies of miniscule scale. See for instance [s11 forms new investment opportunity](https://web.archive.org/web/20060429093327/http://s11.no/News/2004-12-05)
* [soiland.no blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20050829042609/http://soiland.no/blog) (2004--2007) -- first attempt to blog, maintained with [Plone](https://plone.org/) until one day an `apt-get dist-upgrade` left the Zope db unreachable. Note that the Plone CSS is not rendering as intended in the Web Archive's Wayback Machine.
* [«Stian Søiland»](https://soiland.no/archive-2002/) (1999-2005) -- My Norwegian blog about student life in Trondheim. Archived from PHP rendering on <http://soiland.no/> and previously at <http://stain.portveien.to/> and <http://stain.nvg.org/>  going through several designs: [#1](https://web.archive.org/web/19991110081333/http://stain.portveien.to/) [#2](https://web.archive.org/web/20000823213412/http://stain.portveien.to/) [#3](https://web.archive.org/web/20020923141939/http://stain.portveien.to:80/) 
* [Welcome to Stian Søiland's Homepage](https://soiland.no/archive-1996/) (1996) -- My very first webpage, slightly [redesigned in 1997](https://soiland.no/archive-1997/) -- Note that links to `404 Not Found` subpages was the norm back then, as all HTML was edited per page. Recovered from old ZIP-drives.
