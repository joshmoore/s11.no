## Archived personal websites

These are slightly embarrassing archives from more innocent times, preserved so you can see why I didn't become a Web designer.

* [s11.no ≔ з11.ею](https://s11.no/) (2020--) -- The current [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)-based static website, launched primarily as home for archived HTML pages. Based on [ronu-hugo-theme](https://github.com/softwareyoga/ronu-hugo-theme) by Deepak Karanth, see [stain/s11.no](https://github.com/stain/s11.no). The alternative domain <https://з11.ею/> is available to test UTF-8 support.
* [s11.no](https://s11.no/archive-2015/) (2015--2019, Internet Archive) -- Bootstrap-based landing page for [Søiland Software](https://w2.brreg.no/enhet/sok/detalj.jsp?orgnr=984699573), linking to whatever development Web services was running at the time.
* [Stian Soiland-Reyes](https://soiland-reyes.com/stian/archive-2009/) (2007--2020) -- While the last blog post was in 2009, this Wordpress site survived another decade before being archived as static pages.
* [La familia Soiland-Reyes](https://soiland-reyes.com/archive-2008/) (2008--2010) -- Website for the Soiland-Reyes wedding in 2008. Archived from Wordpress as static pages.
* [s11 solutions](https://web.archive.org/web/20060701000000*/s11.no) (2004--2006, Internet Archive) -- This domain <http://s11.no/> used to host a parody of enterprise-targeting IT consultancies of miniscule scale but with grandeur ambitions. See for instance [s11 forms new investment opportunity](https://web.archive.org/web/20060429093327/http://s11.no/News/2004-12-05). 
* [soiland.no blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20070328235352/http://soiland.no/blog) (2004--2007, Internet Archive) -- first attempt to blog, maintained with [Plone](https://plone.org/) until one day an `apt-get dist-upgrade` left the Zope db unreachable. Note that the Plone CSS is not rendering as intended in the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine.
* [«Stian Søiland»](https://soiland.no/archive-2002/) (1999-2005) -- My Norwegian blog about student life in Trondheim. Archived from PHP rendering on <http://soiland.no/> and previously at <http://stain.portveien.to/> and <http://stain.nvg.org/>  going through several designs: [#1](https://web.archive.org/web/19991110081333/http://stain.portveien.to/) [#2](https://web.archive.org/web/20000823213412/http://stain.portveien.to/) [#3](https://web.archive.org/web/20020923141939/http://stain.portveien.to:80/) 
* [Welcome to Stian Søiland's Homepage](https://soiland.no/archive-1996/) (1996) -- My very first webpage, slightly [redesigned in 1997](https://soiland.no/archive-1997/) -- Note that links to `404 Not Found` subpages was the norm back then, as all HTML was edited per page. Recovered from old ZIP-drives.
