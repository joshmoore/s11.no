	<h1>16-http-describedby-conneg</h1>
	<p>
	  This landing page has two signposting HTTP headers:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a type="text/turtle" href="metadata">describedby content-negotiated to metadata.ttl</a> (text/turtle, type attribute declared)</li>
		<li><a type="application/ld+json" href="metadata">describedby content-negotiated to metadata.jsonld</a> (application/ld+json, type attribute declared)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The client is forced to use HTTP content negotiation in this scenario as both links have <code>metadata</code> as target. 
		The server will add a Content-Location of the seleted resource.</p>
