	<ul>
        <li><code>rel=cite-as</code> to <a href="https://w3id.org/a2a-fair-metrics/59-rda-r1-01m-t8-type-and-only-about/">w3id PID</a></li>
		<li><code>rel=type</code> to <a href="https://schema.org/AboutPage">https://schema.org/Dataset</a></li>
		<li><code>rel=item</code> to <a href="test-apple-data.csv">CSV file</a> (text/csv, type attribute declared)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This is a test for FAIR principle RDA-R1-01M - Plurality of accurate and relevant attributes are provided to allow reuse.</p>

	<p>Test 8: If rel=type includes AboutPage as in Test 7, does it also include a second rel=type?
	</p>	
	<p>
		In this negative case there is a downloadable item, and the 
		and the <code>rel=type</code> <code>AboutPage</code> is included, however
		a specific type to describe the item (e.g. <code>Dataset</code>) is missing.
