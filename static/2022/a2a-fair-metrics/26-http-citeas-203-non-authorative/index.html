	  This landing page has only one signposting HTTP header:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://example.com/rewritten/w3id.org/a2a-fair-metrics/26-http-citeas-203-non-authorative/">cite-as to w3id</a> </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	The server will return status code <code>203 Non-Authoritative Information</code>, e.g. as delivered by a proxy
	that may have transformed the content. 
	The client may still consume the Link headers, but should present a warning to the user as the proxy may
	have rewritten the headers, as shown with the PID in this example.
