	<p>
		This landing page has these FAIR Signposting HTTP headers:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><code>rel=cite-as</code> to <a href="https://w3id.org/a2a-fair-metrics/52-rda-f1-01d-t1-data-pid/">w3id
				PID</a></li>
		<li><code>rel=item</code> to <a
				href="https://w3id.org/a2a-fair-metrics/52-rda-f1-01d-t1-data-pid/files/1">https://w3id.org/a2a-fair-metrics/52-rda-f1-01d-t1-data-pid/files/1</a>
			(text/csv, type attribute declared, w3id PID)
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This is a test for FAIR principle RDA-1-01D - Data is identified by a persistent identifier.</p>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong>This is a bit unusual setup where the data file itself has a separate PID, which do not include file extension. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The actual URI <a href="https://s11.no/2022/a2a-fair-metrics/52-rda-f1-01d-t1-data-pid/files/1"></a> is not exposed by the Signposting headers. In this example the full file name with extension <code>1.csv</code> is hidden by the web server URL, but will be exposed by the <code>Content-Location</code> header, which in many browsers are reflected in the download filename.
