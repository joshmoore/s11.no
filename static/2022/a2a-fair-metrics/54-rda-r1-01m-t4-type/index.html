	  This landing page has these FAIR Signposting HTTP headers:
	</p>
	<ul>
        <li><code>rel=cite-as</code> to <a href="https://w3id.org/a2a-fair-metrics/54-rda-r1-01m-t4-type/">w3id PID</a></li>
		<li><code>rel=type</code> to <a href="https://schema.org/CreativeWork">https://schema.org/CreativeWork</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>This is a test for FAIR principle RDA-R1-01M - Plurality of accurate and relevant attributes are provided to allow reuse.</p>

	<p>Test 5: Each rel=type points to a URL.</p>	
	<p>
		In this case there is no separate downloadable item, 
		the content (this test) is contained in the page (like an open access journal article), 
		thus this is <strong>not</strong> typed as an <code>AboutPage</code>.
